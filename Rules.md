* Give 1.5hrs everyday. 
* Solve 2 questions in 1.5 hr slot.
* How to solve a problem while learning(for the first time):
  * Give a maximum of 1hr to understand the concept.
  * if understood, try to code in 30mins.
  * not not understood, ask someone to explain (30mins max)
* How to solve a problem while learning(after first time):
  * Try to code in 20mins.
  * Go to GFG find the problem and try to pass all the test cases.
  * If not succeeded in 15-20mins, then check the concept on gfg.
  * if concept is clear but implementation is problematic, then try to understand the code from gfg.
  * Now code again from scratch. within 20mins. and pass all the test cases in 30mins.

NOTE: 
1) The time mentioned is applicable for all the questions, and there can be exceptions of tough questions. 
2) Not to worry if you miss the time allocated.
3) solve 1 question in 1.5 hrs is alright instead of 2. 
4) **Perseverence**
